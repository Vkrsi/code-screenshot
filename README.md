New Feature: Github Gist to Code Screenshot

When you add vkrsi to the Github Gist URL, it should open a page with a screenshot for copying.

Example: https://gist.github.com/ahoward/1105733

To generate, use vkrsi instead of github in the URL: https://gist.vkrsi.com/ahoward/1105733

If you want any feature added to the code screenshot app or are having a problem, please create a new issue.
